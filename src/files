This directory contains the c++ Sources.

"constants.hpp"
Global Definitions for the Game.

"main.cpp"
Contains the main-function. Defines and Creates a Playfield that
is responsible for the logic of HighMoon.

"object.cpp"
"object.hpp"
Defines an abstract Spaceobject that has information about Position,
Speed, Weight... and can detect a collision. Each object in HighMoon
is a Spacobject.

"galaxy.cpp"
"galaxy.hpp"
Defines a class Galaxy that contains all objects within a Galaxy
(Planets, Shots, Extras...) except the Flying-Saucers. A Galaxy 
is able to init itself and to detect collisions and react on them.
Further on, classes for Extras, Stones (Rings and Moons), Planets,
Storms (actually called Blackholes), Wormholes and the Ufo are
defined.
Ufo contains HighMoon's "ai". Actually it is pretty simple =) but
as it works...

"graphics.cpp"
"graphics.hpp"

Sprite, Font, Goldrain, Stars and Shootingstar =). Sprite 
also contains a static function for drawing pixels.

"language.cpp"
"language.hpp"
Actually my native language is German - which is not the most 
know in the world. Depending an the main download-regions and
surely people giving support for translations, these files
contain a class Language that returns all Gametexts in a
selected Language. Thanks to Marek, Melissa and Andy, Victor
and Marco for their translations! 
Language supports English, German, French, Polish, Portuguese,
Spanish and Russian Language.	 

"shoot.cpp"
"shoot.hpp"
Shoot is surely the most important Object of HighMoon =). It is
an abstract class that defines Shot-Parameters and is able to 
detect collisions, calculate next step or a complete flightpath of
itself.
Laser, Heavy and Cluster are types of Shots. Explosion defines
a small animation of an explosion.

"sound.cpp"
"sound.hpp"
Defines a Soundset. Sounds can be played via index.

"vector_2.cpp"
"vector_2.hpp"
These files define a class for using Vectors easily.
